**Goal-Based Savings Tracker**

Ngimpi is a goal-based savings tracker app designed for users who want to save money toward specific items or dreams. Instead of just saving randomly, Ngimpi helps you turn your dreams into achievable financial goals with clear timelines and consistent progress tracking.

## ðŸŒ™ Why "Ngimpi"?

The app is named **"Ngimpi"** â€” a casual Indonesian word for "dreaming." In everyday language, "ngimpi" is often used jokingly or skeptically, as in "Keep dreaming," when someone mentions what seems like an unrealistic wish.

But Ngimpi the app is a **redefinition** of that word.

Here, we believe that dreams aren't just fantasies â€” they're goals waiting to happen. With Ngimpi, we turn casual dreams into reality, not by luck or wishful thinking, but through **consistent action** and **small daily commitments**.

*A little saving each day brings you closer to your dream.*

## âœ¨ What is Ngimpi?

Ngimpi transforms the way you save money by focusing on **specific goals** rather than aimless saving. Whether you're dreaming of:
- ðŸ“± A new smartphone
- ðŸ“· That camera you've been eyeing
- ðŸš² A bicycle for weekend adventures
- ðŸŽ¯ Any other personal goal

Ngimpi helps you get there with purpose and motivation.

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Set Your Goal**: Input the item you want to save for and its target amount
2. **Plan Your Savings**: Define how much you can realistically save per day or week
3. **Track Your Progress**: The app calculates your expected goal completion date
4. **Stay Motivated**: Watch your progress grow as you get closer to your dreams

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Goal Visualization**: See exactly what you're saving for with images and descriptions
- **Smart Calculations**: Automatic timeline predictions based on your saving capacity
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators to keep you motivated
- **Flexible Savings**: Set daily or weekly saving amounts that work for your budget
- **Achievement Timeline**: Know exactly when you'll reach your goal

## ðŸ’¡ The Purpose

Ngimpi's mission is to help users stay **motivated** and **consistent** with small daily savings until their dreams become reality. By breaking down large financial goals into manageable daily or weekly contributions, we make saving feel achievable and rewarding.

This isn't just a savings tracker â€” it's a reminder that even the most casual dream ("ngimpi") can become real, as long as you're willing to commit and stay consistent.

No more wondering "Will I ever afford this?" â€“ with Ngimpi, you'll know exactly when your dream becomes affordable.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

Ngimpi embraces a philosophy that's **motivational but grounded**, **relatable and emotionally driven**:

- **Friendly and Simple**: Clean, intuitive interface that doesn't overwhelm
- **Optimistic, Not Overly "Hype"**: Realistic encouragement that builds genuine confidence
- **Progress-Focused**: Visual elements that reinforce your journey toward personal goals
- **Emotionally Connected**: Every feature reminds you that your dreams matter and are achievable

We believe that every dream is achievable with the right plan and consistent action. Ngimpi is designed to make financial goal-setting simple, visual, and motivating â€” because your dreams deserve more than just wishful thinking.
